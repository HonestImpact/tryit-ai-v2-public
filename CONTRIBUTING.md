# Contributing to Noah

> **Every contribution must strengthen Noah's Trust Recovery Protocol**

## 🛑 MANDATORY: Read Before Any Changes

Before making ANY code changes, you MUST:

1. **📋 Read [Strategic Pause Protocol](.strategic-pause.md)** - Answer all 5 strategic questions
2. **🏗️ Follow [Architecture-First Framework](.architecture-first.md)** - Complete the 6-phase decision process  
3. **📐 Commit to [Code Covenant](.code-covenant.md)** - Meet quality standards and review requirements

**These are not optional. They protect Noah's integrity and prevent reactive fixes that break existing functionality.**

## 🎯 Noah's Core Mission

Noah is a Trust Recovery Protocol - an AI assistant designed to build genuine trust through:
- **Honest communication** about limitations and uncertainties
- **Collaborative problem-solving** with users
- **Elegant tool generation** in under 5 seconds
- **Multi-agent coordination** (Noah, Wanderer, Tinkerer)
- **Session-based toolbox** for persistent user value

**Every change must strengthen these principles.**

## 🚨 Non-Negotiable Requirements

### **Always Preserve:**
- Noah's conversational persona and Trust Recovery Protocol
- 5-second tool generation performance (83% improvement achieved)
- Multi-agent system coordination and caching
- Session toolbox functionality and user workflows
- TypeScript strict mode and comprehensive error handling

### **Never:**
- Make reactive fixes without understanding root cause
- Break existing functionality for new features  
- Add complexity when simplicity will suffice
- Skip the strategic pause and architecture-first protocols
- Compromise on code quality or maintainability

## 🏆 Success Criteria

Your contribution succeeds when:
- **Noah is more capable** without losing existing functionality
- **Code is more elegant** (not more complex)
- **Architecture is stronger** (not more fragile)
- **User trust is enhanced** (not diminished)
- **Future development is easier** (not harder)
