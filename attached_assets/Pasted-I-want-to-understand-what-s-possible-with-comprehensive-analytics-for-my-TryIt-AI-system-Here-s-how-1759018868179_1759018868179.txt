I want to understand what's possible with comprehensive analytics for my TryIt-AI system. Here's how I think about the data relationships I'd eventually want to report on:

USER JOURNEY ANALYTICS:
- Anonymous user sessions → conversation patterns → trust progression over time
- First-time vs returning users → engagement depth → conversion to tool usage
- Session frequency → conversation complexity → tool sophistication requests

CONVERSATION FLOW ANALYTICS:
- Conversation length → topic evolution → trust level changes
- User question types → Noah's response strategies → user satisfaction indicators
- Skeptic mode usage → trust recovery patterns → long-term engagement

AGENT PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS:
- Noah direct responses → processing time → user engagement
- Subagent consultation patterns → response quality → user feedback
- RAG query frequency → component retrieval success → tool generation quality

TOOL GENERATION ANALYTICS:
- User requests → RAG components retrieved → final tool complexity
- Tool types generated → user adoption rates → reuse patterns
- Simple vs complex tool requests → success rates → user satisfaction

SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION ANALYTICS:
- Response times by request type → bottleneck identification → performance improvement
- RAG component usage patterns → library optimization → new component needs
- Error patterns → failure modes → system reliability improvements

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE:
- Usage patterns → feature popularity → development priorities
- Tool adoption rates → user value demonstration → monetization readiness
- Session engagement → retention patterns → growth metrics

Is there anything you would include at this point that is not listed above. 

Can you design a database schema that captures these analytical relationships? I know this is comprehensive - what's realistic to implement in phases, and what would require more complex data modeling? 

Focus on anonymous session tracking while maintaining the ability to link all these data points for meaningful analysis.
